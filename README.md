# vitaQuake+

This is a crowd sourced effort to enhance Rinnagatamante's [vitaQuake engine](https://github.com/Rinnegatamante/vitaQuake)
This vitaQuake version is based on February 14th commit of vitaQuake.

NOTE: Use this repo's version of vitaGL currently. In the future I may update the engine to use the latest vitaGL.
